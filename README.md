## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- `make` for easy command execution.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/groupthinking/AJOB4AGENT.git
    cd AJOB4AGENT
    ```

2.  **Set up your environment:**
    Copy the environment file template. This file is crucial for configuring the agent to your preferences.
    ```sh
    cp .env.prepopulated .env
    ```
    Now, edit the `.env` file with your job preferences.

3.  **Provide Optional API Keys (in `.env`):**
    - To enable AI-powered resume tailoring and the interview pack generator, add your `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
    - To enable daily email reports, fill in the `SMTP_*` variables.
    - To enable Apollo integration (future feature), add your `APOLLO_API_KEY`.

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    Use the `Makefile` to install all required Python packages.
    ```sh
    make install
    ```

## Usage

### Running the Main Pipeline

To run the entire daily job automation pipeline, from filtering to reporting, simply use:
```sh
make run
```

### Viewing the Dashboard

To start the web dashboard, run:
```sh
make dashboard
```
Then, open your web browser to `http://localhost:8000`. The dashboard will display the contents of `crm/applications.csv` and auto-refresh.

### Generating an Interview Pack

To generate a prep document for a specific company:
1.  (First time only) Add some sample news articles or text to `data/sample_articles.txt`.
2.  Run the script with the company name:
    ```sh
    python scripts/generate_interview_pack.py --company "Name of Company"
    ```
    This requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` to be set in your `.env` file. The output will be saved in the `reports/` directory.
