**Recommendation:** Review open PRs - if merged, delete these branches. If still in progress, keep them.

### 2. Active Branches from December 2025

- `copilot/clean-up-branches` (Dec 15, 2025) - **CURRENT BRANCH**
- `copilot/clean-up-repo-for-public-use` (Dec 9, 2025)
- `copilot/remove-ai-code-slop` (Dec 4, 2025)

**Recommendation:** Current cleanup work. Keep current branch until merged.

### 3. Very Old/Stale Branches (August-September 2025)

These branches are 3-4 months old and likely abandoned:

- `coderabbitai/docstrings/d12357c` (Sept 10, 2025)
- `copilot/fix-12` (Sept 13, 2025)
- `copilot/fix-9` (Aug 25, 2025)

**Recommendation:** These are likely abandoned and should be deleted if no longer needed.

## Cleanup Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Delete Old Abandoned Branches:**
   ```bash
   # Very old branches (Aug-Sept 2025) - verify they're not needed first
   git push origin --delete coderabbitai/docstrings/d12357c
   git push origin --delete copilot/fix-12
   git push origin --delete copilot/fix-9
   ```

2. **Review and Close Duplicate/Overlapping Feature Branches:**
   - Several branches appear to have overlapping functionality (e.g., multiple autofill and Glassdoor branches)
   - Consolidate or close duplicate work

3. **Check PR Status:**
   - Review all open PRs associated with November branches
   - Merge completed work
   - Close stale PRs
   - Delete branches after merging

### Branch Naming Convention

Current branches use inconsistent naming:
- `copilot/*` - Generated by GitHub Copilot
- `feat/*` - Feature branches
- `dependabot/*` - Automated dependency updates
- `coderabbitai/*` - Generated by CodeRabbit AI

**Recommendation:** Establish and document a consistent branch naming strategy.

## Maintenance Process

### Regular Branch Cleanup

Implement a regular branch cleanup process:

1. **Weekly:** Review and merge ready PRs
2. **Bi-weekly:** Delete branches for merged PRs
3. **Monthly:** Identify and flag stale branches (>30 days without updates)
4. **Quarterly:** Review flagged branches for deletion

### GitHub Settings

Consider enabling these GitHub repository settings:
1. **Automatically delete head branches** - Delete branches after PR merge
2. **Branch protection rules** - Require PR reviews before merging to main
3. **Stale branch detection** - GitHub can flag branches not updated in X days

## Summary

- **Keep:** Current working branch and December branches
- **Review:** All November 2025 branches - merge PRs and delete if complete
- **Delete:** August-September 2025 branches (likely abandoned)
- **Process:** Implement regular branch cleanup procedures

## Next Steps

1. Review open PRs on GitHub web interface
2. Determine which November branches are complete and can be merged
3. Delete branches for merged PRs
4. Delete confirmed abandoned branches (Aug-Sept)
5. Document branch management policy in repository
6. Enable automatic branch deletion on PR merge
